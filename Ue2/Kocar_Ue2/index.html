                <h2>The Country of Others</h2>
                <p>Author: Leila Slimani</p>
                <p>Description: The French-Moroccan writer Leila Slimani's third novel The Country of Others is the first book in Slimani's trilogy. A gripping tale set during World War II. Its protagonist Mathilde is a young Frenchwoman who leaves her hometown for Amine, a Moroccan who fought alongside the French. Inspired by Slimaniâ€™s family history, the novel sustains an unflinching gaze at the instances of power dynamics, gender, and sexuality in a complicated social setting.</p>
