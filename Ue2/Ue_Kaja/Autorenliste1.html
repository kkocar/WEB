        <h2>Leila Slimani</h2>
        <p>Leila Slimani is a critically acclaimed French-Moroccan author and journalist. She gained international recognition for her novel "Lullaby" (Chanson douce), which won the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 2016. Her writing often explores themes such as power, gender, identity, post-colonial society, and the immigrant experience.

Slimani's work is known for its bold, honest storytelling and psychological depth. With her recent trilogy starting with "The Country of Others", she delves into her own family history and Moroccoâ€™s complex post-war era, reflecting on cultural clashes and the legacy of colonialism.</p>
